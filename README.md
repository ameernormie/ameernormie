### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Hybrid apps in React Native. I am also developing web solutions in React.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and systems architecture. I love Rust.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on new and exciting projects in Javascript and Rust. I especially want to contribute in Rust so that I can make use of my learning and implement it in a project that makes an impact.
- 💬 Ask me about anything programming related. I can help you understand Javascript and it's core features. I also teach Javascript to my friends.
- 📫 How to reach me: Best way to reach me is through my personal email `ameernormie@gmail.com`. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a self taught developer.
